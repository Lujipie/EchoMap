This script is a real-time mapping system for an RC car. It uses Pygame to display a grid and plot points based on sensor data from the car. The Arduino sends angle and distance measurements, which the script converts into Cartesian coordinates to map the surroundings. Outlier points are filtered using a function to ensure accuracy. The car's position and proximity to obstacles are displayed visually, and a sound alert is triggered if it gets too close to a wall. The program runs continuously, updating the map in real time until stopped
