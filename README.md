This file FinalProduct.py is a real-time mapping system for an RC car. It uses Pygame to display a grid and plot points based on sensor data from the car. The Arduino sends angle and distance measurements, which the script converts into Cartesian coordinates to map the surroundings. Outlier points are filtered using a function to ensure accuracy. The car's position and proximity to obstacles are displayed visually, and a sound alert is triggered if it gets too close to a wall. The program runs continuously, updating the map in real time until stopped.

The GarageSensor file runs a similar code but since our servo motor got fried it doesnt intake angle and only detects the distance in front of it and beeps the sensor on the car gets too close to a wall.

The file ronaldo is the Arduino IDE code that runs all the hardware and sends the data from the Servo motor, gyroscope, accelerometer, Ir sensor, and Ultrasonic sensor to the pyserial code for the Final product to call using pyserial. 

Since a lot of our hardware broke during the competition we had to scrap a lot of data such as the tilt to find the angle the car is facing and acceleration to find the current position of the car. Our IR sensor also broke so we couldnt take better distance data, and our Servo motor also overheated causing it to be very inconsistent. Due to all these factors we settled on our final product that only finds distance the wall is from the wall at each angle(if the servo works) and if the wall where the sensor is facing is close to the sensor it will beep.
